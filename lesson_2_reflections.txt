What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    Once you initialize a repository it is sortof like a blank slate. So no commits or changes have been made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area allows programmers to review which files will be pushed "live" in their commit. This allows for better control and understanding for breaking down files and saves.
    Being able to have a buffer between the working directory gives great control between these items.
